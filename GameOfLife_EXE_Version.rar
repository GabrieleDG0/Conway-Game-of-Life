Game Of Life EXE version

To make it easier for users to run the Python scripts without needing to have Python installed, I’ve added a .rar file that contains the scripts compiled as .exe files.

What’s been added:
A .rar archive containing the Python scripts compiled into .exe format.

How to use it:
- Download the .rar file from the repository.
- Extract the contents of the .rar file to a folder of your choice.
- Run the .exe file to execute the script without needing to install Python.

Note: The .exe version is provided to simplify usage and should work on any Windows system without additional dependencies.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
